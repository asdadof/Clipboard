# clipboard

This is a small project where I experimented with developing a browser extension. The extension functions as a clipboard manager, allowing users to store and access copied text more efficiently. It helps keep track of multiple clipboard entries, making it easier to retrieve previously copied items without losing important data.

This project was primarily a learning experience, where I explored browser extension APIs, local storage, and UI design for a lightweight productivity tool.
